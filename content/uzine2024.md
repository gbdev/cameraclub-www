Inaugural Edition of the Gameboy Camera Club uZine

* [Download (A4 Page With Assembly Instructions)](/2024-08-23_GameboyCameraClub_uZine.pdf)
    - This is the main version with all the pages and assembly instructions provided. You need a scissor and a glue stick to assemble this, but overall when assembled it should be the size of a thumb.
* [Download (A4 Page For Scan And Cut Based Machines)](/2024-08-23_GameboyCameraClub_uZine_ScanAndCut.pdf)
    - This version has no instructions and is intended for use with a [Brother ScanNCut](https://www.brother.com.au/en/scanncuts/all-scanncuts) which will autodetect the outline of these pages and cut around it. This is useful in larger workshops events with lots of participants. Aside from the cutting of the page which is handled by the ScanNCut, the assembly process is still the same with a glue stick and hand folding of pages.
